# Stuff I use
Exactly what it says on the tin. This will be updated every now and then, FYI. None of this is exceptional, or anything like that. 

## Hardware
- HP Enxy x360

    Got this one earlier this year to replace a dying, broken laptop I was using for the past 5 or so years. Currently my main machine.

- Seagate 4TB External HDD

    Bought this because I needed something to keep up with my bad torrenting habits. Will probably suffice for the next year, or so.

- Corsair Scimitar RGB ULTRA
   
   This thing has 12(!) side-buttons. Map them to random stuff so I can use them whenever I want to. 

- Logitech G012

    Backup mouse. I actually got this cheap thing in 2019(?) because the trackpad on my aforementioned previous laptop was in a beyond unusable state. Have kept with it since.

## Software
- OS: Fedora Linux 

    If it's good enough for Linus, it's good enough for me.

- Browser: Chromium
    
    I don't care how important 'keeping the web free' is; I will die before I ever have to use Firefox again. 

- Editor: Emacs

    `C-x C-c`. GitHubs own code editor is also usable enough for me to deal with doing small patches within it. 
 
- Terminal: Alacritty

    It just works.

- Media Player: MPV

    Better than VLC.
    
## Other shit
- Samsung Galaxy J3 Luna Pro

    I've used this since 2018, making it one of the oldest pieces of technology I still put up with. It's literally falling apart as I use it, but I'm too cheap to buy something new that doesn't totally suck.

- OfficeMax Office Chair

    My ass loves this thing. My back, too.

- Pepsi

    I drink it.

- Uhh fuck, what else?
- Oh, I know!
- Samsung Chromebook

    This is the second worst Computer I've had the displeasure of using. My school bought a bunch of these - refurbished, and in bulk - and had to make us students pay $15 to even use them. I barely even use this one. Currently use it to charge my phone while I sleep.
