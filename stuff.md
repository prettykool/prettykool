# Stuff I use
Exactly what it says on the tin. This will be updated every now and then, FYI. None of this is exceptional, or anything like that. 

## Hardware
- HP Enxy x360

> Got this one earlier this year to replace a dying, broken laptop I was using for the past 5 or so years. Currently my main machine.

- Seagate 4TB External HDD

> Bought this because I needed something to keep up with my bad torrenting habits. Will probably suffice for the next year, or so.

- Logitech G012

> I actually got this cheap thing in 2019(?) because the trackpad on my aforementioned previous laptop was in a beyond unusable state. Have kept with it since.

## Software
- OS: Windows 10 

> Sorry, I'm too lazy to install Linux on my main machine. 

- Browser: Chrome Canary

> This one barely functions right, but I still like the fast pace of the updates.

- IDE: VSCode

> I really only use this as a text editor. I tried getting into Vim, but eventually I ended up crawling back to something that didn't involve me memorizing a thousand different keybinds.

- Random utility: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

> This is a fucking blessing. Allows me to run Linux apps, and use Bash natively in Windows. Can't gush about this enough.

- Compiler: Clang

> Switched to this because I was getting sick of GCC. Also because I think some of the features it has are pretty neat.

- Terminal: Windows Terminal

> Very interesting choice, I know. I just wanted to use something more customizable than the pre-packaged one Windows already has.

- Media Player: VLC

> I've been meaning to switch to MPV for a while now, since VLC is just so much more inferior in comparison. That said, I'm sticking to it for now, while I look to find a decent MPV frontend for Windows.

- Password Manager: Buttercup

> Works like any other password manager, and looks nice while doing it.

- Screencapture Tool: Snip & Sketch

> Actually comes preinstalled on Windows, and does exactly what it's supposed to do. Used to use Lightshot on my old computer, but ditched it once I realized that another one came prepackaged with the OS that did the exact same thing.

- Misc Tool: PowerToys

> This shit makes Windows 100x better. How the fuck is this not in it by default? 

## Other shit
- Samsung Galaxy J3 Luna Pro

> I've used this since 2018, making it one of the oldest pieces of technology I still put up with. It's literally falling apart as I use it, but I'm too cheap to buy something new that doesn't totally suck.

- OfficeMax Office Chair

> My ass loves this thing. My back, too.

- Pepsi

> I drink it.

- Uhh fuck, what else?
- Oh, I know!
- Samsung Chromebook

> This is the second worst Computer I've had the displeasure of using. My school bought a bunch of this - refurbished, and in bulk - and had to make us students pay $15 to even use them. I barely even use this one. Currently use it to charge my phone while I sleep.
